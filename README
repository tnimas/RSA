This program implements the encryption and decription algorithm RSA. 
The program is written in the course of the Yaroslavl State Technical University basics of information security.

You can use it to encrypt with a key of 1024 bits or less. 
The program is written for educational purposes and hardly suitable for use in real projects. 
Since the encryption speed is low and can not use a key length such as 2048 bits or more.

To run the program requires MS Windows with .net framework 4.0
To open the source code you can use  Visual Studio 2010 or later.

To use:
Create input.txt in the directory with the application.
Enter "encrypt" in the first row and content for encryption in second. 
Run the application, resulting in the file output.txt.
Change the data in input.txt:
"
decrypt_<secret_key_values_from_output.txt>
<encrypted_numbers_from_output.txt>
"
Example:
"
decrypt_1141767437,3736723013
1033536525 0 2432010274 0 2912479932 0 1033536525 0 1032457496 0 1243236317 0 2237939005 0 1564549046 0 2790811102 0
"

Run the application again.
As a result, output.txt will be the source content.
"
Secret key (d,n): 1141767437,3736723013

You can set key length, text encoding and input\output file name in exe.config file.
